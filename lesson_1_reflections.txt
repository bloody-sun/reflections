How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It shows changes - what was previously and after change

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    You can see every change, so you see your previous mistakes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    +it's your decission when to make commit
    +you don't have cluttered versions
    -you may forgot to commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    In google or dropbox you don't work on connected files (or at least it's not designed for you to do so)

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    by git diff and showing between which nr i want to check changes

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    It's easy to get back and also find, where you've made a mistake

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Don't know, maybe will present it to Gosia to work on it while making website?
